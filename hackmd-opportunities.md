Opportunities
===

## Security

- [ Native sign-in with multi-factor authentication (MFA) #319 ](https://github.com/hackmdio/hackmd-io-issues/issues/319) (P0)
    - Currently MFA is through third-parties, e.g. Twitter, GitHub, and etc.
- Backup notes based on folder architecture (P1)
    - Organize notes into folders in the app. 
    - *Settings* > *Download all notes* downloads the notes into local directories that match the app folder architecture.
    - This will make backing up a large amount of notes  user-friendly.

## Version control systems (VCS)

- Allow users with *Admin* and *Write* access to Push/Pull with GitHub a main Note they are not the owner of. (P1)
    - The Push and Pull options do not show in a shared user's Note.
    - Note overflow menu (3 dots in the top-right) > *Versions and GitHub Sync* > *Pull from GitHub* or *Push to GitHub*
    - Potential workaround: Create a public team: [Create and manage Team](https://hackmd.io/@docs/create-and-manage-team)
        - [Unable to create public team with a personal account #325](https://github.com/hackmdio/hackmd-io-issues/issues/325) (P0)
    - Potential workaround: Push a separate note.
        - User with access writes to the main Note in HackMD.
        - User with access creates a new Note, copies the entire main Note, and pushes changes to GitHub.
- GitLab integration for individual use (P1)
- [Radicle.xyz](https://radicle.xyz) integration â€“ [Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1h1C7IlcHJeRDy72E2ycb7br3lumpU631rN9CMpm8E/edit#heading=h.rprz9yqw2qqg) (P2)

## Editor

- What you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) editor for Markdown (P1)
    - Great for beginner users to get started writing
- Spelling and grammar check
    - [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) compatibility (Open-source) (P1)
    - Add new words to the spell checker dictionary (P1)
- Offline web editor and/or desktop app (P2)
- Import multiple .md files from local storage (P2)
